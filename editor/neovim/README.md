# Spacevim

- Install the plugins with `:SPInstall`
- Update the plugin with `:SPUpdate`
- **Note**: `:UpdateRemotePlugins` should be executed manually in order to enable auto-completion.

If you got a vimproc error like [vimproc] vimproc's DLL:
"~/.cache/vimfiles/vimproc.vim/lib/vimproc_linux64.so" is not found. Please read :help vimproc and
make it, you may need to install make (from build-essential) and a C compilator (like gcc) to build
the dll (see issue #435 and #544).

Then do `:VimProcInstall`
